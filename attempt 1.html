<h2>Homo sapiens is human</h2>
<h3>Is there other homo that evolved from Homo erectus???</h3>
</header_1>
<body_1>
<p><strong>Yes , there is , but Homo sapiens were the ones who survived the evolution process . However, it was likely not the only species that evolved from Homo erectus. Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthal man) lived in Europe and southwestern to central Asia but became extinct 40,000 years ago. Homo floresiensis (the Hobbit) evolved in Asia but became extinct 50,000 years ago. Homo heidelbergensis lived in Europe, China, and parts of Africa but became extinct 200,000 years ago.</strong></p>
